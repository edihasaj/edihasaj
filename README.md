### Hi there 👋

🌱 I'm [Edi Hasaj](https://portfolio.hasaj.net). 🔭 I'm currently working on closed and open source projects. 

It makes me so happy 😄 to see that my projects interest someone else and together we are building something useful.

⚡You can use my [Developer Tools](https://tools.hasaj.net) if you are a developer.

Or checkout my [Blog](https://blog.hasaj.net) if you have free time 🤷‍♂️😎
